Find your blueprints folder(Make sure SE saves your blueprints locally not in the steam cloud, you can change it in the game settings) 
My blueprints are located in C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Blueprints\local
Click **open blueprint** button, enter any blueprint folder and select **bp.sbc** file for the program.
